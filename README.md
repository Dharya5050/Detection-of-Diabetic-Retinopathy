# Detection-of-Diabetic-Retinopathy
This project aims to develop a computer vision system for the automated detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR) from retinal images. Diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes and a leading cause of blindness among adults. Early detection and treatment are crucial for preventing vision loss.
